# zebra-emulator
Paper saver that emulates server needed for BrowserPrint (Zebra ZPL)

Runs a service that acts like the server that runs on your computer, which sends the ZPL to the Zebra Printer from the browser (Browser Print).

It will log what is being sent to the printer.  You can upload to an online viewer - that would be a good enhancement is for this program to display what would be printed (like ngrok request viewer) :)
